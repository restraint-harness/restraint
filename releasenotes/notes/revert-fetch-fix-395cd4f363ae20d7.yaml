    Fix: Revert Fetch URL fix
    Backing out fix to provide precise directory matching for
    `repoRequires` and `fetch` operation. The problem is user's
    selection data is not precise.  User's testing will be hindered
    with this change.  This issue was presented to some user's
    who chose to instead make their directory definitions more precise.
    Refer to close comment in Issue 272 on 3/13 for more details.
    If folks decide to reintroduce this change, they should also
    apply pull 289.
