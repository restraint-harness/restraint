    Fix: Set OOMPolicy=continue to prevent killing restraintd (Fedora/RHEL9+)
    Upon memory depletion, prevent the kernel from killing restraintd service.
    Keep restraintd running, but log the service event. This OOMPolicy setting
    is only available for RHEL9+ and Fedora distros.  Other distros will
    remain unchanged.
