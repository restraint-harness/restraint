    RHEL 5 and 6 builds are no longer created from this version onward.
    This is partly due to upgrades of libraries used by restraint which
    are not compatible with the older RHEL releases. Older restraint releases
    for RHEL 5 and 6 prior to this 0.4.0 release will still exist in the
    download repositories.
