    Fix: rstrnt-reboot to ignore SIGTERM
    When this scripts performs a reboot, it does a loop forever to prevent
    from returning to the calling process.  This changeset ignores SIGTERMs
    to keep it from interrupting the loop.  We must keep the SIGKILL in place
    however so there is still a small window of opportunity of returning to
    caller but the window has been narrowed with this change.
